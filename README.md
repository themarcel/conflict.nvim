# conflict.nvim

_A simple Neovim plugin to resolve merge conflicts with ease._

Its inline conflict UI is similar to the one found in
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/merge-conflicts#_editor-conflict-markers).
The plugin was inspired by the no longer maintained
[git-conflict.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/git-conflict.nvim). It began as
a fork but resulted in a complete rewrite focused on a simpler codebase with the
latest API.

## Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
return {
    "niekdomi/conflict.nvim",
    config = function()
        require("conflict").setup({
            -- your config here
        })
    end,
}
```

## Configuration

The following are the available options with their default values. You can set a
mapping to `false` to disable it.

```lua
require("conflict").setup({
    default_mappings = {
        current = "cc",
        incoming = "ci",
        both = "cb",
        base = "cB",
        none = false,
        next = "]x",
        prev = "[x",
    },
    show_actions = true,        -- Show clickable [Accept Current | ...] labels
    disable_diagnostics = true, -- Disable LSP/Diagnostics while conflicts exist
    highlights = {
        -- Names of highlight groups to use for sections
        current = "DiffText",
        incoming = "DiffAdd",
        ancestor = "DiffChange",
    },
})
```
