# conflict.nvim

_A simple NeoVim plugin to resolve merge conflicts with ease._

Its inline conflict UI is similar to the one found in
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/merge-conflicts#_editor-conflict-markers).
The plugin was inspired by
[git-conflict.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/git-conflict.nvim). It began as
a fork but resulted in a complete rewrite focused on a simpler codebase with the
latest API.
